# Welcome  to wdagosto.github.io repository!

This repo was made to hold the development files of Mr. Wilton's personal webpage.

The original ideia from using Knight Lab's timeline was from [@rdagosto](http://github.com/rdagosto), who made use of the first version of their Timeline.
Now I ([@euaaron](http://github.com/euaaron))  am making a rework of the page, using not only **Timeline v3**, the updated version of the KL's Timeline, but also a bit of my own touch. Hope it works...

> You can find the original codes for the Timeline v3 used in here can be found on [Knight Lab CDN](https://cdn.knightlab.com/) under "**TimelineJS3**" section or at [NUKnightLab's GitHub repository](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS3).
